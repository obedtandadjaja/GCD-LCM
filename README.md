# GCD-LCM
A simple GCD-LCM recursive algorithm in Java that I did for my Google interview.

It is incredibly short (10 lines of code) recursive algorithm that will guarantee to make you look smart.

### Tests/Sample Outputs
```
GCD(124, 80) = 4
LCM(124, 80) = 2480
GCD(2345, 105) = 35
LCM(2345, 105) = 7035
GCD(6543, 756) = 9
LCM(6543, 756) = 549612
GCD(12, 90) = 6
LCM(12, 90) = 180
GCD(2123, 4213) = 11
LCM(2123, 4213) = 813109
GCD(24132, 1278) = 6
LCM(24132, 1278) = 5140116
GCD(31, 87) = 1
LCM(31, 87) = 2697
```

### How to run the program
1. Clone this repo or copy and paste the code in src/GCD_LCM.java
2. Go to the directory of the file
3. Type ```javac GCD_LCM.java```
4. Type ```java GCD_LCM <number 1> <number 2>```
